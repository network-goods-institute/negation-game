# Negation Game

The Negation Game is an innovative platform for collective decision-making, sensemaking, and governance that rewards intellectual honesty and evidence-based reasoning. It extends prediction markets beyond objective outcomes to subjective beliefs, creating an information market for the Overton Window of ideas.

## What Makes It Unique

Unlike traditional discussion platforms that use linear or threaded formats, the Negation Game operates on a graph structure where:

- **Points** represent claims or positions
- **Negations** represent counterarguments that directly challenge points
- **Relationships between ideas** enforce intellectual consistency

The system implements three core mechanisms that work together to create a truth-seeking environment:

1. **Epistemic Leverage**: Rewards users who declare how they could be wrong or how they might change their mind, implementing Popper's principle that scientific claims must be falsifiable
   
2. **Restake-Slash-Doubt Triangle**: Creates economic incentives for intellectual honesty
   - **Restaking**: Committing to change your mind under specific conditions
   - **Slashing**: Fulfilling that commitment when evidence proves compelling
   - **Doubting**: Challenging others' willingness to change their minds

3. **Rationales**: Structured collections of points and negations that represent comprehensive viewpoints

## Applications

The Negation Game can be used for:

- **DAO Governance**: Temperature checks on proposals with quantified collective conviction
- **Decentralized Content Moderation**: Community-driven content ranking and filtering
- **Capital Allocation**: Directed funding toward ideas that withstand scrutiny
- **Research Coordination**: Identifying the most promising hypotheses and experiments

## Theoretical Foundations

The system draws from multiple disciplines:

- **Game Theory**: Creates incentives that align individual behavior with collective truth-seeking
- **Category Theory**: Defines ideas through their relationships with other ideas
- **Mechanism Design**: Implements scoring rules that achieve desirable aggregate outcomes

## Current State

The Negation Game is currently running at [negationgame.com](https://negationgame.com) with core mechanisms implemented:

- Graph-based discussion structure
- Points and negations system
- Epistemic leverage
- Restaking, slashing, and doubting mechanisms
- Rationales for complex argument structures
- Space-based communities for focused discussions

## The Vision

While futarchy starts after a proposal is written and renders only a yes/no decision, the Negation Game integrates game-theoretic properties directly into the sensemaking process. It aims to:

1. Create a system where making strong claims without evidence is risky
2. Reward willingness to change one's mind based on evidence
3. Convert disagreement into funding for exploration and experimentation
4. Enable high-quality collective reasoning at scale

The ultimate goal is to transform how groups make decisions, shifting from popularity contests to systematic identification of the most defensible ideas.

## The Epistocratic Future

The Negation Game represents an important step toward a new governance approach called "epistocracy" - a successor to futarchy that is epistemically sensitive and can start with open questions rather than specific proposals.

If successful, it will not only create a better governance layer for DAOs and other organizations but also establish a new capital allocation mechanism that enables profitable funding of exploratory research at scale.
