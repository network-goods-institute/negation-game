Generate 3 strong counterpoints that challenge the STATEMENT above. For each counterpoint:

- Present a perspective that is opposite and mutually exclusive to the original statement
- Think beyond simple word opposites - consider deeper implications, assumptions, or alternative frameworks
- Introduce relevant concepts or aspects that weren't explicitly mentioned in the original statement but are important to the discussion
- Make sure it's not redundant with existing counterpoints
- Keep it concise and clear (max ${POINT_MAX_LENGHT} characters)
- Make it a declarative statement that expresses a single idea
- Use neutral tone and avoid personal opinions
- Focus on logical assertions rather than mere disagreement
- Go straight to the point without opening remarks
- Ensure it makes sense on its own
- Use modern, straightforward language

Focus on being clear and insightful, as if you're explaining a thoughtful counterargument to a friend in today's world.`;
