            <h2>What is a Negation?</h2>
            <p>
                Negations are counterarguments to points. A negation challenges a point
                directly, creating a paired relationship. Negations can be either
                counterarguments (arguing the point is incorrect) or objections
                (arguing the point is irrelevant rather than wrong).
            </p>
            <p>
                If you disagree with a point because it&apos;s factually inaccurate, create
                a counterargument. If it&apos;s irrelevant, create an objection. This is
                the core mechanism for structured disagreement in the game.
