            <h2>What are Rationales?</h2>
            <p>
                Rationales are structured collections of points and negations that represent complete arguments.
            </p>
            <p>
                They allow users to create and share comprehensive reasoning structures rather than isolated points. This helps in presenting a more holistic perspective on a topic.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can create a rationale to organize multiple points and their corresponding negations into a single, coherent argument.
