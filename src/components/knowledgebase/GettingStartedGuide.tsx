            <h2>Getting Started & Basic Interactions</h2>

            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Connect your account</strong>: Use the connect button to authenticate. You can link your wallet, email, Google Account, or Farcaster.</li>
                <li><strong>Explore the feed</strong>: Browse existing points, negations, and rationales. Use the search function to find specific topics.</li>
                <li><strong>Make a point</strong>: Create your first statement to start participating.</li>
                <li><strong>Use the AI Assistant</strong>: Navigate to the Chat tab to ask questions, generate points, and explore rationales with our built-in AI Assistant.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Basic Interactions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Endorse a point</strong>: When you see a point you agree with, you can endorse it with cred.</li>
                <li><strong>Negate a point</strong>: Create a counterargument to challenge an existing point. You can endorse your negation while creating it.</li>
                <li><strong>Create a rationale</strong>: Organize multiple points and negations into a structured argument (see &quot;What are Rationales?&quot;).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Complex Interactions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Restake on a point</strong>: Show your conviction by committing to change your mind if a negation proves true.</li>
                <li><strong>Slash your restake</strong>: Acknowledge when a negation has changed your mind.</li>
                <li><strong>Doubt a restake</strong>: Challenge someone&apos;s commitment to intellectual honesty.</li>
                <li>(See &quot;The Commitment Mechanism&quot; for more details on Restakes, Slashes, and Doubts).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This guide helps you understand the core concepts. Think of it as a
                tutorial. You start with an idea (a &quot;Point&quot;), challenge it with a
                counter-argument (a &quot;Negation&quot;), and then use special actions like
                Restaking, Doubting, and Slashing to navigate the debate. It&apos;s about
                making strong arguments and being willing to change your mind when
                presented with good reasons â€“ all while managing your &quot;cred&quot; (reputation)
                and earning &quot;favor&quot; (influence).
