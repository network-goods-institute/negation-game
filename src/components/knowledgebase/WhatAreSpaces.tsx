            <h2>What are Spaces?</h2>
            <p>
                Spaces are separate communities or contexts within the Negation Game. Each space can have its own focus, culture, and set of discussions.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Global Space</strong>: The default space where all users can participate.</li>
                <li><strong>Specialized Spaces</strong>: Topic, community, or DAO-specific spaces for focused discussions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each space has its own feed of points, negations, and rationales, allowing communities to develop focused conversations around their specific interests or domains.
