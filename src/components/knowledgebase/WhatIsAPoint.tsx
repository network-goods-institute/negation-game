                    A &quot;Point&quot; in Negation Game represents a single, distinct idea,
                    argument, or claim. It&apos;s the basic building block of any discussion or
                    rationale. Points can be connected to each other through Negations,
                    forming a graph of arguments and counter-arguments. Creating a clear,
                    concise Point is the first step in participating in the game.
